AnimationRecipes
================

A tiny Objective-C library with simple animation recipes for iOS UIViews inspired by Animate.css. More recipes are being added and a feature to chain animations is being worked on. CocoaPod support is being added soon.

How to use
==========
Copy AnimationRecipes.h and AnimationRecipes.m into your project. Use one of the several AnimationRecipe functions on your UI View like so. 

[AnimationRecipes flash:myUIView completion:nil];

You might want to turn off AutoLayout if it gets in the way.
